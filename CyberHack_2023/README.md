I participated in this CTF mainly for fun and to re-engage with the topic. I had no intention of participating for the full 24 hours or losing too much sleep. The two unsolved problems in this writeup were not attempted during the event.

The event was structured as an individual competition, however, I collaborated with my friend Alejandro Diaz (Github: [alejodiazg](https://github.com/alejodiazg)).
